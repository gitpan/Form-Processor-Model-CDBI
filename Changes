0.07 Wed Dec 19 05:56:19 UTC 2007
    use_ok() was used incorrectly and Test::More
    upgrade to .74 caused it to fail.

0.06 Wed Jul 25 06:41:01 UTC 2007
    Fixed typo when calling update_model and
    no do_transaction exists.  Closes #28464
    as reported by Yann Kerherv√©. 

0.05 Thu Jun 21 04:39:44 UTC 2007
    Add "clear" attribute to fields which the Model uses
    to set columns null.  Useful for the odd case of a
    row that holds fields dependent on other fields
    (e.g. a form that changes based on selected form elements)

    Allows a global active_column method in the form
    class to set the column to check in lookup tables.
